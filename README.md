#### What is Octoloom?
Octoloom is a "group" of individual"s" (literally just loom) who share knowledge, code, and other software information to help create a better future for technology. "We" (also more like I) make software and "useful" (useless) libraries to help you "solve" problems (or create new ones).

Have fun exploring our profile!
